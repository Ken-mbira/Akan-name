            <p> The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born.<br> These names usally differed based on gender where the name for a certain day foy a boy-child was different
                from that of a girl child.<br> Most Ghanaians have at least one name from this system followed by their christian names, You can achieve this too.</p>
